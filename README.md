## Overview
Â» It's another solution for a [frontend mentor coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt) that I did to practice my handling of tailwind CSS because probably I'll use this CSS framework in my upcoming adventures in React (stay tuned).
